## Inspiration
There is 53,818 electric vehicles registered in WA state. This exploratory data analysis identifies potential electric vehicles buyers by understanding the electric vehicles market in WA. To accomplish this, I needed to understand the EV most populated zip codes with their respective demographic data. I focus on household income level and commutes times: Does tend to own an electric car is correlated to how much a household earn and how much a household commute to work?

## Hypothesis Testing
#### Does a higher income or lower income relates to having more or less electric cars?  Higher commutes times can be a contribuitor to buy a electric car?

```
H0: There is no statiscally significant relationship between household income level/commute times and the number of electric vehicles by zip code.
HA: There is a statiscally significant relationship between household income level/commute times and the number of electric vehicles by zip code.
Significance level: 0.05
```
Normalize the median income data/median commute time and total E.V. population data to be comparable between each other.

```python
def normalize(df,column):
    cols_to_norm = [column,'Total_EV']
    df[cols_to_norm] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df[cols_to_norm])
    return df
```

```python
median_income_norm = normalize(ev,'median_income')
median_commute_norm = normalize(ev,'Median_commute')
print(median_income_norm[:3])
print(median_commute_norm[:3])
```

       ZIP Code  Make_decode  median_income  Median_commute  Total_EV
    0     98107            0       0.032427        0.372514 -0.140544
    1     98370            1      -0.246282       -1.776191 -0.478660
    2     98360            2      -0.029047        0.372514 -1.056531
       ZIP Code  Make_decode  median_income  Median_commute  Total_EV
    0     98107            0       0.032427        0.372514 -0.140544
    1     98370            1      -0.246282       -1.776191 -0.478660
    2     98360            2      -0.029047        0.372514 -1.056531


Next, calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value for testing non-correlation.

```python
def pearsonr(x,y,alpha=0.05):
    r, p = stats.pearsonr(x,y)
    return r,p
```

```python
print(pearsonr(median_income_norm['median_income'].values,median_income_norm['Total_EV'].values))
print(pearsonr(median_income_norm['Median_commute'].values,median_income_norm['Total_EV'].values))
```

    (0.59373613499395383, 3.7922998932025516e-58)
    (-0.0034307164978868562, 0.93333529849276775)


1. The coefficient 0.6 shows a strong correlation and the p-value is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis and aprove the alternative where there is s a statiscally significant relationship between household income level and the number of electric vehicles by zip code.

2. There is a weak negative correlation between commute times and getting an electric car. Also, the p-value is greater than our alpha, so we fail to reject the Null hypothesis.

# Why people are choosing Tesla and Nissan Leaf? 
During my analysis I wanted to know why E.V drivers were choosing certain models over others and how were they reacting about their products through tweets and reviews. For this section, I web scrapped cars.com to obtain reviews from Tesla and Leaf, the most popular Electric Vehicles in WA. Also, I created a connector to Twitter API to get tweets from @GreenCarsReports, an account where electric cars news are posted. The goal was recognize the polarity of the reviews, set a threshold and classify them in bad, good or neutral.

## @GreenCarReports Tweets Analysis

```
def detect_polarity(text):
    return TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity

df['polarity'] = df['review'].apply(detect_polarity)
df['polarity_neutral'] = df['polarity'].apply(lambda x: True if ((x > 0)&(x<=0.1)) else False)
df['polarity_negative'] = df['polarity'].apply(lambda x: True if x <= 0 else False)
df['polarity_positive'] = df['polarity'].apply(lambda x: True if x > 0.1 else False)
df['blob'] = df['review'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(x).noun_phrases)

cols = ['blob','polarity','polarity_negative','polarity_positive','polarity_neutral','review']
df = df[cols]
```
